# Bagcamp

Bagcamp is an online music platform and community, serving as an alternative to Bandcamp. It prioritizes electronic music genres and aims to be a particularly supportive and visible space for trans, gender non-conforming (GNC), and LGBTQ+ artists, while welcoming all independent musicians. It emphasizes fair compensation for artists and direct fan support.

## Vision

- **Community Building**: Fosters a supportive and interactive community for artists and fans, with a strong emphasis on safety, respect, and inclusivity for trans and LGBTQ+ individuals.
