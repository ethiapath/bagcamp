## Development Principles

Throughout all phases, development will follow these principles:

1. **User-Centered Design**: All features will be designed with the needs of artists and fans in mind.

2. **Incremental Deployment**: Features will be deployed incrementally, with frequent small releases rather than large infrequent ones.

3. **Testing First**: Every feature will include automated tests before deployment.

4. **Accessibility**: All components will be designed to WCAG standards from the beginning.

5. **Performance**: Code will be optimized for performance at every stage.

6. **Security**: Security best practices will be followed throughout development.

7. **Feedback Loop**: User feedback will be incorporated continuously to improve features.

## Decision Points and Pivot Opportunities

At the end of each phase, there will be a review to:

1. Evaluate the success of implemented features
2. Gather user feedback
3. Reassess priorities for upcoming phases
4. Consider potential pivot points if needed

This phased approach allows for flexibility while maintaining focus on delivering a high-quality platform that meets the needs of artists and fans.
